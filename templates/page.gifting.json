We believe that crafting premium gin goes hand in hand with preserving and respecting the natural environment.<\/p><p><strong>Natural Ingredients<\/strong><\/p><p>We use only natural botanicals in our gin, many of which are grown in our own garden or foraged locally in Fife. This approach not only ensures the freshest ingredients but also reduces our carbon footprint by minimising transportation.<\/p><p><strong>Sustainable Packaging<\/strong><\/p><p>To combat single-use glass, we have introduced refillable gin pouches. These lightweight pouches are fully recyclable and significantly reduce the energy required for production and transportation. Customers can return used pouches to us for recycling, promoting a circular economy. <\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Recycling Initiatives<\/strong><\/p><p>We offer a recycling scheme that transforms our 70cl glass bottles into eco-friendly candles. These candles are made with eco-soy wax, making them both environmentally and vegan friendly. This initiative gives our bottles a second life and reduces waste. <\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Renewable Energy<\/strong><\/p><p>Our distillery operates on 100% renewable energy sourced from our own hydro schemes. By harnessing natural power, we significantly reduce our carbon footprint and set a sustainable example within the industry. <\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Electric Vehicles<\/strong><\/p><p>Our sales team has transitioned to 100% electric vehicles, further reducing our carbon emissions and demonstrating our commitment to sustainable practices. <\/p><p><\/p><p>Through these initiatives, Darnley's Gin strives to create a product that not only delights the palate but also honours and preserves the natural world.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","buttons_style":"filled","override_button_colors":false,"button_background_color":"#e68819","button_text_color":"#ffffff","section_padding_top":0,"section_padding_bottom":35,"text_overlapping_image":false,"section-width":"full","layout":"left","text_alignment":"center","colors":"white"}}},"order":["main","image_with_text_kxFBCb"]}
