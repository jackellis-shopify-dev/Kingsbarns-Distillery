This approach not only ensures the<br\/>freshest ingredients but also reduces our carbon footprint by minimising<br\/>transportation.<\/p><p><strong>Sustainable Packaging<\/strong><\/p><p>To combat single-use glass, we have introduced refillable gin pouches. These<br\/>lightweight pouches are fully recyclable and significantly reduce the energy<br\/>required for production and transportation. Customers can return used pouches<br\/>to us for recycling, promoting a circular economy. <\/p><p><strong>Recycling Initiatives<\/strong><\/p><p>We offer a recycling scheme that transforms our 70cl glass bottles into<br\/>eco-friendly candles. These candles are made with eco-soy wax, making them both<br\/>environmentally and vegan friendly. This initiative gives our bottles a second<br\/>life and reduces waste. <\/p><p><strong>Renewable Energy<\/strong><\/p><p>Our distillery operates on 100% renewable energy sourced from our own hydro<br\/>schemes. By harnessing natural power, we significantly reduce our carbon<br\/>footprint and set a sustainable example within the industry. <\/p><p><strong>Electric Vehicles<\/strong><\/p><p>Our sales team has transitioned to 100% electric vehicles, further reducing<br\/>our carbon emissions and demonstrating our commitment to sustainable practices.<br\/><\/p><p>Through these initiatives, Darnley's Gin strives to create a product that<br\/>not only delights the palate but also honours and preserves the natural world.<\/p>","text_size":14,"text_bottom_spacing":20}}},"block_order":["heading_GDDhkY","richtext_TjhKGR"],"settings":{"section_width":"narrow","text_alignment_desktop":"center","text_alignment_mobile":"center","section_padding_top":60,"section_padding_bottom":60,"colors":"white"}},"image_with_text_caiPFV":{"type":"image-with-text","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/darnleys_gin_cottage_1080_x_1080.png","title":"A Cottage Gin","text":"<p>The derelict farm cottage next to our whisky distillery in the village of Kingsbarns was the perfect space to realise our dream of distilling gin in Fife, where our family have lived and worked for centuries.<br\/><br\/>In the gardens surrounding Darnley’s Gin Cottage, we grow as many botanicals as the Scottish weather allows but more exotic ingredients, like cinnamon and grains of paradise, need warmer climates so are sourced from growers around the world that we’ve come to know and trust.
